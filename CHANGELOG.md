# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to `aipack` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog, and releases use semantic versioning tags.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0]

### Added

- **SSH URL support**: `registry fetch`, `registry add`, and `pack install` now detect `git@host:path` SCP-style and `ssh://` URLs as git sources, avoiding HTTPS credential prompts.
- **`registry add <url>`**: Configure a registry source without fetching — useful offline or in setup scripts.
- **`registry sources`**: List configured registry sources with cache status. Supports `--json` output.
- **`pack install --ref`**: Override the git ref when installing from URL or registry name.
- **`[installed]` markers**: `registry list` and `registry search` now indicate which packs are already installed.
- **`aipack init` auto-fetches registry**: Initialization now fetches the default registry so packs are discoverable immediately.
- **`aipack doctor` git check**: New `git_available` warning check detects missing git or Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS.
- **Actionable git error hints**: Common failures (HTTPS auth, SSH timeout on port 22, Xcode CLT missing) now include specific remediation steps.
- **Installer git warning**: `install.sh` warns if git is not available and suggests `xcode-select --install` on macOS.

### Changed

- `registry fetch` help and docs updated with SSH examples and `ssh://` scheme documentation.
- `registry remove` help now references `registry sources` for listing.
- README "First Use" section updated: `aipack init` auto-fetches, added registry-name install example.

## [0.4.0]

### Added

- **Multi-source registries**: `registry fetch <url>` saves each source independently under `~/.config/aipack/registries/` and records it in `sync-config.yaml` for future fetches.
- **Bare fetch iterates all sources**: `registry fetch` (no URL) fetches every source in `registry_sources`, falling back to the compiled-in default.
- **Git auto-detection**: URLs ending in `.git` or used with `--ref` are fetched via git clone. New `--ref`, `--path`, and `--name` flags for explicit git coordinates.
- **`registry remove <name>`**: Remove a registry source from sync-config and delete its cache.
- **Merged registry view**: `registry list` and `registry search` now merge local entries (highest priority) with cached sources in list order.
- **Public catalog seeded**: `aipack-core` and `essentials` packs added to the default registry.

### Changed

- `registry fetch` no longer merges into a single `registry.yaml` — each source is cached as a separate file. Existing local `registry.yaml` entries are still honored at highest priority.
- `--prune` is deprecated (emits a notice). Cached registries are overwritten on each fetch.
- Profile docs updated to schema v2.

### Removed

- `--registry` flag on `registry fetch` (single-file merge target). `--registry` on `list`/`search` is retained for single-file override mode.

## [0.3.0]

- Initial release
